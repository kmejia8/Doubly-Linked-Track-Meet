# Doubly-Linked-Track-Meet
Implemented a C program using a doubly linked list to manage runners in a track meet. Each node stores lane, bib number, name, school, and times. The program supports insertion at head or after a node, removal, and printing all entries, demonstrating dynamic memory allocation and list traversal.
